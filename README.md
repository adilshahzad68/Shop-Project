# Shop-Project
Shop Design an interface or an abstract class called assortment.  
Then write a class "product" that implements the interface assortment. 
Using the factory design pattern, create 4 or 5 products available in your store. 
Please choose a type of your shop, and create products adequate to the chosen type. Prepare a class "shopping cart" that will be created using a singleton and could create a list of products which contains a number of pieces and the net, and tax and the gross prices. Class shopping cart should contain methods for adding and removing elements and changing the number of pieces of the product, and displaying the contents of the shopping cart.
